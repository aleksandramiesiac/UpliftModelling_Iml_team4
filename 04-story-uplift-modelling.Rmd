## Introduction 
TODO(oryginał): Put a description of the problem here. 
*indicate the data source. *
We will use data about **Chemotherapy for Stage B/C colon cancer** from `survival` package in R. Dataset avaliable: `survival::colon`. Here's [link](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/survival/html/colon.html) to destription.

### What is Uplift Modelling?

For classical algorithms in machine learning it is hard to predict causal impact of the event because they are more suited for predicting the results after an action. In some cases, such as a marketing campaign or medical treatment, that causal impact might be extremely important. Due to the possibility of using two training sets (treatment and control groups) by uplift modeling this problem was solved. 

Uplift modeling is one of the techniques or a branch of machine learning that tries to forecast class probability differences between group exposed to some action or therapy and control group (without that action or therapy).

This technique also allows to discover in research those groups of patients for which treatment was most beneficial, so it is commonly used not only in marketing campaigns or medical treatments but also in other customer services.

### Dataset Description
We use data from one of the first successful trials of adjuvant chemotherapy for
colon cancer.There are two type of treatment:

 - Levamisole is a low-toxicity compound previously used to treat worm
infestations in animals and its effects on the treatment of colon cancer have been noted; 
 - 5-FluoroUracyl(FU) is a moderately toxic (as these things go) chemotherapy
agent. This is the 'strongest' one treatment. 

Both of these medications are given after the cancer excision, it's adjutant chemistry, that means 'extra post-operative".

There are two records per person, one for recurrence and one for death.
Dataset contains 16 features described below and 1858 observations

Variable name | Description|Type
--|-----|-
id| id |categorical
study| 	1 for all patients| categorical
rx| Treatment - Observation/Levamisole/Levamisole+5-FluoroUracyl|categorical
sex| Sex od patient - Male/Female |categorical
age| Pateint's age in years | continuous
obstruct| Stenosis of the colon by the cancer, which is blockage by the tumor |binary
perfor| Perforation of colon, that means id there was a hole in the colon| binary
adhere | Adherence to the surrounding organs (e.g. bladder)| binary
nodes | Number of lymph nodes with detectable cancer i.e. during the operation the lymph nodes that were attacked by the cancer are cut out. For the operation to be successful there should be at least 12 lymph nodes.|continuous
time | Days until event or censoring.The time of receiving the treatment is considered to be time = 0, the time that passed in the variable time is the time until death or relapse from receiving the treatment.|continuous
status | Censoring status |binary
differ | Differentiation of tumour cell (1=well, 2=moderate, 3=poor). The more the better because it is more like colon cells. |categorical
extent | Extent of local spread, what cells did he reach(1=submucosa, 2=muscle, 3=serosa, 4=contiguous structures). The less the better.| categorical
surg | Time from surgery to registration (0=short, 1=long) | categorical
node4 | More than 4 positive lymph nodes | binary
etype | Event type: 1=recurrence, 2=death | categorical

### Ideas
There are many ways to use this data:

- to predict the patient's life expectancy depending on whether or not he or she will receive treatment, 
- whether the treatment is effective or not 
- life expectancy depending on the medicine administered.
And that last point we will deal with. 

### Why It's worth?
When a patient learns about the disease - colon cancer - he usually asks **how much time he has left?** And now what? What is the treatment? The doctor may indicate a number of therapies that may be effective, but this model will help to provide more accurate data and answer the question about life expectancy.

## Preprocessing data
We remove columns:

- `id`
- `study`
- `etype`

Distribution of the variable `rx` is as below

 Levamisole | Levamisole + 5-FU | Observation
 - | - | -
 620 | 608 | 630

and this feature has been categorised.
The dataset has been divided into 

- X - all feaures (without time and rx)
- y - target variable (time)
- tratment - rx variable

## Model 
To predict model we used algorithms from the package [causalml](https://github.com/uber/causalml) in python.
To optimize hyperparameters we used algorithms from the package [hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) also in python.
All notebooks and codes you can find in [github](https://github.com/aleksandramiesiac/UpliftModelling_Iml_team4).

The final model is `XGBTRegressor` with parmeters

 - colsample_bytree =  0.7324146695038634, 
 - gamma = 0.8249750889337837,
 - learning_rate = 0.8882649077192536,
 - max_depth = 6,
 - min_child_weight = 0.4152689004191612,
 - n_estimators = 250.

This gives as Average Treatment(Lev) Effect 70.49 and Average Treatment(Lev+5-FU) Effect 70.89.
